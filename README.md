# Pomobud Chrome Extension

Pomobud is a productivity Chrome extension that helps you stay focused and manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This was made as a fun side project to learn more about the chrome API and polish my Javascript skills. There are one or two issues, maybe I'll get to them!

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Customizable Pomodoro timer intervals
